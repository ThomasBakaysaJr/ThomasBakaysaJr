## Hello! I'm Thomas.
please excuse the mess, I'm currently putting this page together.

I started my academics at the University of Texas at Austin but that was derailed due to Covid19.
Currently I'm a junior at ETAMU, specifically the Rellis Campus.

### Courseload
My courses have given me experience working in teams, both as driver and not. 
Recent coursework involed working with databases, specifically MySQL, as well as networking.
Currently my classes are focused on AI for potential cyber security enhancement as well
as networking, data and cryptographic security.

## Projects
While most of the projects seen here are from my classes, the MacroYourself app is a custom app I am currently developing 
as a meal planner with micro and macro nutrient tracker.
